# Onboarding

Let's go through some important onboarding information.

## Student Handbook

student handbook (would have to be changed for remote) must be signed before access to ironboard class
 - expectations (timing, effort)
 - must finish the prework beforehand

## Github

Github will soon be one of your most important social media profiles. It will be like a portfolio for others to see you work.

Be professional. Make your username something appropriate and include your full name in your profile. It will also help us when working with you! Including a photo as well will help us out too.

## Blogging

We <3 blogging. It's important to showcase what you're learning and teach others at the same time. Teaching is one of the best ways to learn something, and blogging is a great way to teach! It also shows your involvement in the community by contributing knowledge. 

Have your blog on any platform that suits you, but if you're already blogging personally, we recommend keeping your technical blog separate. But use your best judgment.

Some platforms we like: [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Github Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).

You need to write **one blog post a month**. It can be about what you're learning, a technical challenge you overcome, a walkthrough of something you were initially confused by, a side project you may be working on, any cool tips you've learned about anything technical, etc.

Share it! We'll retweet it and feature it on the Flatiron blog.
